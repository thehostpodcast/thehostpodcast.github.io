is calling from Washington, D.C. where he is a 22nd grader at The George Washington University pursuing a PhD in Biology. To make up for his lack of formal artistic training, he posts short stories to the internet, prompting praise such as ‘Wow what a voice!’ from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and ‘It’s uncomfortable’ from a user named skrokstar. Eric will be elbows-deep in parasitic roundworms until his thesis is done.
