known affectionately as "Mitchy" by The Host's creator, has dialed in from the 310, where he's a high school English teacher by day and an aspiring novelist by Host listening hours. He hails from the 253 and misses the Seattle Supersonics, but plays a lot of basketball to numb the pain of loss. Mitch writes about kindness and portals and other things he thinks are cool. Maybe he'll be published by the time the balding process reaches its inevitable conclusion.
