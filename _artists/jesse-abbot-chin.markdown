is cold calling from the side of the road somewhere nearby, we think. This Boston-born boy who graduated from LMU with a BA in Theatre Arts can be seen and sometimes only heard on regional, national, and international ads. He’s hoping to expand his repertoire to include intergalactic broadcasts when the opportunity becomes available. He’s also made a few appearances on your streaming devices, including Bosch on Amazon Prime and Reese Witherspoon’s latest show Little Fires Everywhere which has yet to hit the Hulu platform. He looks forward to a time in his career where name-dropping is an irrelevant strategy and the artistry behind his work speaks for itself.
